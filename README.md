# SellBusTickets

Create an Android app to sell bus tickets

There are 3 ticket options :

single journey ticket sold for 1,10 €

day ticket sold for 2,50 €

week ticket sold for 12 €

The client can order any number of tickets and should pay only once.

Optional 1: The app has a settings menu to edit the value of each ticket

Optional 2: The app has a history menu to store past transactions


The app should integrate with Yavin Android API : https://api.yavin.com/docs/#integration-android

YavinPAY APK file can be found here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/18GeJBBtD_6rvLDuhxYRmDx2naNwA9JoH/view?usp=sharing
